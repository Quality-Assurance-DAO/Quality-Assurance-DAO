- My KPIs arise from (6) Governance : Due : TBA This deliverable will be a"leap of faith" interaction with voters and are a QA assessment of the Governance phase of a funded proposal. In lieu of a quantitative metric I am using "out of 10" to indicate progress. So 5 out of 10 = halfway through project.
> And that's it. Thank you. Before you go, do you have any feedback about how this reporting process has been? We’d like to know any thoughts you have, optional of course.
