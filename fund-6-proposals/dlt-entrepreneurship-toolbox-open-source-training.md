## **Detailed Plan**

**Revisiting the Problem Statement**

Project Catalyst is rapidly expanding, and its decentralized funding platform needs to support industry standard collaborative coding, tracking and documentation tools such as GitHub. 1000s of Cardano developers use version control tools such as GitHub, but there is often a gap in knowledge for entrepreneurs who do not take advantage of GitHub's organisational and collaborative features.

**Introducing the Solution**

In partnership with the Catalyst School – QA-DAO will offer introductory training materials for entrepreneurs to take advantage of open-source tools such as GitHub.

This will provide a series of workshops comprising of a short screencast, screen share and Q&A on the use of GitHub in Project Catalyst projects.

The direction of the workshops will aim to discover participants workflows and examine how these may be documented, reported on, and automated using GitHub. This part of the proposal is offered in collaboration with F6: Improve and Grow Auditability : Distributed Auditability \( [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Auditability/366707-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Auditability/366707-48088) \)
