{% endhint %}

### **Detailed Plan**

### **Revisiting the Problem Statement **

Project Catalyst is rapidly expanding, and its decentralized funding platform needs to support industry standard collaborative coding, tracking and documentation tools such as GitHub. 1000s of Cardano developers use version control tools such as GitHub, but there is often a gap in knowledge for early stage entrepreneurs who do not have the knowledge to take advantage of GitHub's organisational and collaborative features.

### **Introducing the Solution (**How I address the challenge question).

In partnership with the Catalyst School – QA-DAO will offer introductory training materials for early stage entrepreneurs to develop skills in open-source tools such as GitHub.\
This will comprise a series of workshops comprising of a short screencast, screen share and Q\&A on the use of GitHub in Project Catalyst projects.

### **Short screencasts**

The short screencasts will be produced in advance of Saturday workshop sessions and uploaded to Youtube. These will provide bite sized introductions to GitHub tracking and documentation tools.

### **Saturday workshop sessions**

The Saturday workshop sessions will be introduced by the pre-recorded screencasts and followed by a screen share demonstration of the GitHub use cases for that week. The session will conclude with a Question and Answer (Q & A) to explore individual areas of interest and provoke discussion.

### Training Material Content

The training materials will cover :

**Introduction to GitHub for entrepreneurs** - focusing on using issues and project boards (Kanban) to track and manage projects.‌

**Intermediate use of GitHub for entrepreneurs** - focusing on GitHub's document revision features. Pull requests and reviews.‌

**Advanced use of GitHub for entrepreneurs** - static site generation and GitHub Actions. Continuous Integration features.

### **Documentation**

All the workshop materials will be documented and made available in a GitBook documentary format for ease of reference and re-use. All materials will be released under an open-source license.

### **Distributed Auditability**

The direction of the workshops will aim to discover participants workflows and examine how these may be documented, reported on, and automated using GitHub. This part of the proposal is offered in collaboration with F6: Improve and Grow Auditability : Distributed Auditability ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Auditability/366707-48088 )

### **Budget**

**Workshops**

8 Workshops each with 6 hours preparation and 2 hours duration

\= 64 hours

**Youtube**

8 Screencasts each with 2 hours preparation

\= 16 hours

8 Youtube Session recordings – editing and timestamps

\= 64 hours

**Course Documentation and presentation**

8 sections with 8 hours preparation each (1 for each workshop)

\= 64

**Total Hours = 208**

**Total = $ 8320**

### Re**quested funds in USD:**

**$ 8320**

### **Key Metrics**

The following metrics will measure the progress and success of this proposal:

1\) Number of users attending workshops sessions, viewing Youtube videos and visiting online documentary materials.

2\) Survey difference in understanding open-source between those using the workshop sessions and those not.

3\) Survey if gaps have been filled in the entrepreneurial skills base of participants.

4\) Survey if use of open-source infrastructure promotes sustainability of venture plans.
