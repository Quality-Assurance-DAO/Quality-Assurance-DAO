## Challenge KPIs and how we addressed them

The main success metric for the F7 Auditability challenge was _**Number of proposals audited**_; plus a recognition that proposals in different challenges should be audited in ways appropriate to their challenge.&#x20;

But “auditing proposals” as a metric was perhaps premature, since in F7, groundwork still needed to be done to develop the thinking, the methodologies, and the tooling for audit. Several proposals in the challenge addressed methodologies and tooling; but Audit Circle set out to address the underlying thinking, and to look at what needs to be in place to enable effective audit. We took a “problem-sensing” approach, using our diverse connections in the Catalyst ecosystem to find out how the current process was working, and to take the temperature of how the community (both proposers, and others) think the process should be. Both in our meetings and in our survey to proposers, we explored the idea that proposals in different challenges might need to be audited in different ways.&#x20;

The Challenge described its core aim as _**to ensure transparency in the use of Cardano's treasury resources**_. Our meetings discussed how Catalyst might do this, and how far the existing monitoring practices achieve it; we also discussed what “transparency” means in practice. A key issue that emerged in our problem-sensing was the balance between transparency and confidentiality/privacy, particularly around proposers’ IP, and around any personal data that they might hold, for example from project participants.&#x20;

## Proposal aims and how we addressed them

The concept of Audit Circle was similar to that of Catalyst Circle, but for audit issues. Its aims were to problem-sense issues around auditability (including highlighting any confusion in the process, and considering how to identify bad actors); prioritise the issues; and collaborate with the community to suggest potential solutions. The plan was that any solutions proposed could then go through the Catalyst funding process.
