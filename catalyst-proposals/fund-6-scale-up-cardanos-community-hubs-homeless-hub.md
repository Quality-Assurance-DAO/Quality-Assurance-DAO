## Proposal Text

## Problem

Homeless people have a unique culture, with much to share on key issues like value / contribution; but Cardano hasn’t yet engaged with them.

## Describe Your Solution to the Problem

Introduce the Cardano Community to homeless communities in Manchester, UK, through in-person workshops and online sessions

## **Relevant experience**

Stephen has 30 years’ experience in organizing academic, community and business projects.

## Detailed Plan

This proposal will initiate a 6-month experiment in communication and understanding between existing Cardano community members and homeless communities in Manchester, UK, which include a mix of migrant people and UK-born people, and a wide range of levels of ability in English.

We have included money for interpretation where needed, and plan to use and pay people from within the community itself as interpreters.

### Background

Homeless people in developed countries like the United Kingdom form a distinct community. This community is a diverse mix of people from different social backgrounds, cultures, migration status and languages.

Due to our lived experience of exclusion, poverty and marginalisation, and due to the fact that, in order to survive, we have to develop networks of mutual aid and support between ourselves, homeless communities often have a perspective on questions of value and contribution that is unique and vital.

This perspective could enrich the Cardano community; and Cardano could empower homeless people.

The first step in empowering any community to change their lives is to create a space where people can develop and crystallise their OWN understanding of the problem. This might be called community “problem-sensing”.

### Problem Sensing Workshops

A series of workshops will be held with migrant homeless communities in Manchester, UK.

These workshops will explore questions of value, worth and contribution.

### Building a community hub

These initial workshops will build confidence and shared understanding to enable a group of homeless people to lead a community hub.

This hub would have its roots in the homeless community but can also engage others locally. We imagine it leading to an event where homeless people can tell non-homeless locals about blockchain technology and its implications for all of our empowerment.
