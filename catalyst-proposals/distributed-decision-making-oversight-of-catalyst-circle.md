## **Community Oversight**

**How can we help the Catalyst community to get better at distributed decision making within the next two Catalyst rounds?**

The Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook documents and tracks the activities of the Catalyst Circle a initiative started by IOHK to advance governance in Project Catalyst. The aim of the Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook is to improve distributed decision making by making the activities, discussions and decisions of Catalyst Circle accessible to all.

This site is maintained by QA-DAO in collaboration with the Cardano and Project Catalyst communities. All content recorded is open source, licensed under Apache 2.0.

The Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook has been maintained since July 11th 2021.

### **Secretary / Facilitator**

This proposal is separate from the Catalyst Circle Secretary / Facilitator roles. And does not include any associated costs. All documentation and tracking described in this proposal is independent of Catalyst Circle resources.

### Tracking the time spent on maintaining the GitBook

QA-DAO ( [https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/](https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) ) has been tracking the time spent on maintaining the GitBook. 

The raw Clockify data to 30th August 2021 can be found here : 

{% embed url="https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle-Co-ordination/blob/main/Documents/Clockify_Detailed_Report_01_01_2021-31_12_2021(1).csv" %}

A total of 27:40 hours have been spent to the 30th August 2021. Approx 18 hours were spent documenting and tracking in July 2021 and 9 hours in August 2021. More time was spent in July 2021 setting up the GitBook and documenting an extensive problem sensing exercise conducted by Catalyst Circle.

A shift to note-taking on a proprietary platform inhibited documentation and tracking for Circle Meetings 3 and 4. More time may be allocated in September 2021 to resolve this issue. Documented here ( Barriers to tracking and documenting the content of Catalyst Circle Meetings - [https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle-Co-ordination/issues/20](https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle-Co-ordination/issues/20))) and discussed here ([https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/commentary/commentary-on-catalyst-circle](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/commentary/commentary-on-catalyst-circle) ).

### **Roadmap ( Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months)**

**Prior to funding**

**Catalyst Circle Version 1 - July 2021 to September 2021**

Documentation and tracking can be completed and is live.

**3 months**

**Catalyst Circle Version 2 - October 2021 to December 2021**

Catalyst Circle Version 2 roughly coincides with the release of Fund 6 ADA. (November 2022).

Once funded Catalyst Circle Oversight will aim to communicate its documentation and tracking via social media in order to reach a wider audience. Documentation and tracking will be supplemented with commentary. Sponsorships will be sought.

**6 months**

**Catalyst Circle Version 3 - January 2022 to March 2022 (?)**

If Catalyst Circle Version 3 proceeds it will roughly coincide with the release of Fund 7 ADA (February 2022).

But this would require a new Fund 7 proposal.

**12 months**

**Catalyst Circle Version 4+ - April 2022 to September 2022 (?)**

In the long term any oversight should be self-sustaining and sponsorships will be sought to achieve this aim.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Draft Budget**

Given the commitments outlined in the roadmap above it is estimated that 20 hours per month will be spent for 3 months.

A total of 60 hours at $35 an hour = $ 2,100
