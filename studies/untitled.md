## Overview

The purpose of this study is to:

1 – Document and communicate with the Catalyst Community the launch of a token that aims to bridge the Ethereum and Cardano blockchains.

2 – Provide a detailed timeline of a Token launch to inform future strategy, development, and testing in other Catalyst proposals (particularly Token launches).

3 – Assess with the Catalyst Community how different financing models such as outside Venture Capital, in contrast to Project Catalyst funding, may impact the reception of a token launch.

4 – Build an open-source Token Launch Risk Model.

## Scope

This study examines the period between **March 29th** and **April 14th, 2021** when OccamFi announced and released an “Initial Distribution Offer” (IDO) of a token called OCC intended to bring capital liquidity to Cardano via OccamFi’s DEFI LaunchPad.

The roadmap for OccamFi’s LaunchPad is to build a DEX and Capital Markets on its launchpad and progress towards a single governance layer which aims to be a distributed autonomous organisation (DAO).

OccamFi’s web hosted platform is called OccamRazor. The OccamRazor web platform has an overview and detailed section that displays its OCC offering and links to Metamask wallet for transactions.

Some online content will have changed since this study’s publication.

## Prelaunch Timeline Summary

OccamFi began to market its OCC launch to the public from **March 29th, 2021** with a “_Ready for DEFI on Cardano_” announcement on its Twitter feed. Followed by details of OccamFi’s Ethereum to Cardano liquidity bridge on March 30th, 2021.

On **April 1st, 2021**, OccamFi shared information about OCC’s token private investment round and confirmed that participation from leading tech venture capital (VC) firms had concluded. The completion of VC funding led to the opportunity to buy OCC through OccamFi’s public offering on its LaunchPad OccamRazor.

From the outset OccamFi’s announcements attracted commentary from the Cardano community. The reaction to the private VC funding touched upon Cardano’s culture of transparency, accessibility, and community involvement.

Some community distrust was evident in a perception of privileged token pre-allocations.

Responses to OccamFi’s Medium article “_Analysing the Funding Landscape of Cardano_” of the **April 3rd, 2021** requested additional information on a “tiered system for guaranteed participation” which was not immediately forthcoming.

On **April 5th, 2021** OccamFi announced an Ambassador beta testers programme which received a positive response from the community. Although no test data has been made available as OccamFi are not an open-source company.

On the same day Mark Berger, President of Occam Association appeared in an interview with the _Cardano Live_ YouTube Podcast. Mark framed OccamFi’s ETH launchpad as “…_to go from 0 to 1 to attract developers and users, and Cardano to go from 1 to 100_.”

The Chat replay response to the interview highlighted the risk of sniping trading bots and requested further information on the nature of Venture Capital access to the launchpad.

On **April 7th, 2021** OccamFi introduced its Occam Association team and Advisors. The response to this announcement was positive, although further information was requested on the development team.

Other collaborations were announced on April 8th with Moonrock Capital, on **April 9th** with Chris Graffagnino, on **April 10th** with Bakyt Azimkanov and on **April 11th** with Tiago Serôdio.

On **April 11th**, OccamFi presented a first outline of OCC tokenomics in a Medium article. This broke down into 5 key areas. 1. Access to Liquidity Mining Pools, 2. Access to Private Liquidity Pools 3. OccamDAO investments — Continuous Ecosystem Diversification, 4. Pool origination and 5. Cast Out Tokenomics. Responses to the article were mixed with some supporting a strategy of extracting liquidity from Ethereum. While others were sceptical of the risk associated with ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum platform.

## OCC Launch Timeline Summary

The day of the launch, **14th April**, started at **2.30pm** (UTC) with a timer announcing, “_Get ready for the moment we've all been waiting for!_”

Among responses there was some confusion over where to buy the tokens, whether US citizens could participate and reports of the website being down.

At **5:30 PM** (UTC), OccamFi announced that “_The long-awaited moment has finally arrived._” The OCC IDO was Live.

The response to this tweet were numerous and mostly negative.

Complaints included:

* The IDO was sold out in less than 5 minutes.
* The website was down or inaccessible on mobile platforms.
* Wasted ETH transaction fees.

At **5:31 PM** (UTC) OccamFi tweeted a link to their FAQ “_A step-by-step guide to participating in our IDO_” on their GitBook.

The negative responses to this tweet continued.

Complaints included:

* The expense of participating (one person cited a minimum buy of 0.08 ETH costing $168 plus fees).
* The website was down or inaccessible on mobile platforms.

At **5:43 PM** (UTC), OccamFi tweeted out the suggestion to “_Please refresh the page_” to connect to the MetaMask Wallet.

The negative responses to this tweet continued.

Complaints included:

* The website incorrectly identifying desktop/laptops as mobile platforms.
* The effective exclusion of mobile platforms due to downtime.
* The instantaneous sell-out.

At **5:57 PM**, OccamFi tweeted out the announcement that the “IDO sold out in under 30 seconds” and directed buyers to Uniswap.

The negative responses to this tweet continued.

Complaints included:

* The observation that the OccamFi web platform did not work rather than was sold out.
* High fees on Uniswap.
* Messages being ignored on Telegram.

At **6.00 PM** (UTC), OccamFi tweeted out a link to their GitBook on how to “Claim your tokens”.

The negative responses to this tweet continued.

Complaints included:

* Criticism of the distribution model. That only 175 people were able to claim IDO tokens.
* Immediately following an IDO with a Uniswap listing.

At **6.13 PM** (UTC), OccamFi tweeted out an image of people jumping in air with joy, thanking people and citing “_unprecedented levels of participation_.

OccamFi provided the information that “_almost 100k users_” tried to access the IDO which was sold out in under 30 seconds.

This tweet was received particularly poorly.

Complaints included:

* The tweeted image appeared to celebrate a failure and trivialised the frustrations of those unable to access the IDO.
* Frustration with Telegram support directing users to the FAQ.

Two and half hours later, at 9:37 PM (UTC), OccamFi tweeted out the message that “_We understand that some of you were frustrated_”, with a link to a Medium article entitled “_An Open Letter to the Occam.fi and Cardano Community from the Occam Association_”.

Responses to this article were mostly negative.

Complaints included:

* Why only 0.02 % of the IDO was offered to the public.
* Messages being deleted on Telegram.

The timeline ends here.

**Text reads: “Will this be open source? Will the smart contracts be formally verified?”**

_“As we originally mentioned in our Medium articles, we have already undergone a smart contract audit by ScalableSolutions and are in the process of undergoing another one with industry leader, CertiK._

_We believe transparency to be paramount, so we will make the audits publicly available as soon as they are ready. However, our codebase and components are currently proprietary, as our engineers have worked incredibly hard to build our platform, positioning us as a leading provider of liquidity and launchpad capabilities for the Cardano ecosystem.”_

**Note:** Scalable Solutions is also under the management of the Occam Association.

#### OCC Tokenomics and Utility

**It's the moment you've all been waiting for**

It's the moment you've all been waiting for! We're excited to reveal a first glimpse of our #OCC tokenomics, outlining the early benefits of being an OCC OG! Our countdown timer marches on... #OccamRazer #Cardano #DeFi – April 11th

(https://twitter.com/OccamFi/status/1381265819162787842)

Link to Medium Article “OCC Tokenomics and Utility” - [https://medium.com/occam-finance/occ-tokenomics-and-utility-ac0b9a139499](https://medium.com/occam-finance/occ-tokenomics-and-utility-ac0b9a139499)

“OCC Tokenomics and Utility” article key quotes:

“**1. Access to Liquidity Mining Pools**

OCC holders will be able to participate in liquidity mining through OccamRazer pools.”

“**2. Access to Private Liquidity Pools**

Staked OCC tokens will enable access to private OccamRazer pools.”

“**3. OccamDAO investments — Continuous Ecosystem Diversification**

Up to 12,000,000 OCC tokens (or around 12% of the total supply) will be allocated to the OccamDAO Investment Pool. OccamDAO is our decentralised governance layer that will be used to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for the Occam.fi platform overtime.”

**“4. Pool origination**

Projects may apply for verified status from the OccamDAO. This approves a project and moves it to verified or partially verified, or alternatively, for the leading projects, bestows ProjectX status.”

**“5. Cast Out Tokenomics**

Stake pool participants who unstake their OCC tokens incur a small fee, at \~0.60%.”

**“Which Blockchain is OCC Issued On?**

OCC will first be launched for trading as an ERC-20 token. However, Occam.fi’s ultimate goal is to enable the vision of the Cardano ecosystem to surpass other blockchains to become the leading DApp and DeFi ecosystem, and a key to this will be to move liquidity from other blockchain’s to Cardano.”

**Concluding Remarks**

“1. Fair Participation and Inclusivity: We want to extend these principles to all members of the Occam community.”

“2. Technology first: The tokenomics of OccamRazer and OCC will contain many more features than what we have discussed in this article.”

“3. Live cross-chain capabilities: All of our features are going to be available on both the Ethereum and Cardano blockchains, as per our roadmap.”

“The OCC token will soon be made available to the public. The details will be announced shortly. Make sure you follow our social media channels to stay up to date with the latest news from the Occam.fi ecosystem!”

“_What a joke_” – April 14th

“_what a joke, sold out in less than 5 minutes when the site was down half the time!?”_ – April 14th

“_This IDO was a joke. My transaction was reversed. Only 175 people got in. You should do a second round and this time offer 200 million OCC tokens to be sold. Let the MAX allocation be 1 ETH, like it was, and I bet every OCC token will be sold.”_ – April 14th

_#OCC #Cardano You talk about being fair and no information was given on time, plus you can only use metamask. No time for any to deposit eth or get metamask ready. The worst IDO I have seen. You were diffenatly thinking of the Cardano community?_ – April 14th

_“Exactly! And people who use phones weren’t allowed in either...admin did terrible job in chat kept telling people just wait for the announcement after the countdown timer...you want to make it fair yet did the complete opposite and kept it a secret until last second_” – April 14th

_“Guys, to be honest ... stop complaining. 165 people did receive a give away imo. Very generous ... they made from 1 ETH >>> 200k.. nice Wrapped present - Let’s proceed, platform still has lots of potential for us as investor #cardano_ – April 14th (Responding to above)

“_this is so fucked up, just wasted $150 in transaction fees and all I got were pending transactions_” – April 14th

“_Well this went smooth and really helped make me feel like a part of huge and competent community... Why all the marketing and hype if you let only 175 people participate?”_ – April 14th

“_Website not responding. Just means the interest is HUGE. Cant wait for this project and PRAYING this is my first IDO. #OccamRazer”_ – April 14th

“_The contract number is not available on Metamask or UNI. What's going on??”_ – April 14th

“_That was a complete mess. The counter on your website had 1hr left, but yet I saw this tweet in real time and acted immediately only to find this system failing at each step. After multiple attempts it was sold out. 0 confidence_” – April 14th

“_So the thing closes while my transaction is loading but they still took my ETH. Ok cool. Like going to the cinema, giving the guy your ticket and they go “Sorry we’re closed”. Lol there has to be a better way_” – April 14th

**Reponses**

“_is this tweet literally for 175 people_?” - April 14th

“_Such a shame. Long term supporter here as I “was" impressed with what you were saying in your articles that you want to achieve. But the way IDO was handled is exactly opposite. Like literally. People got rekt. Shame you used #cardano name in this_”. - April 14th

“_Claim instructions aren't clear. How can the purchase be accessed once it is complete?”_ - April 14th

“_Instant follow-up for the IDO with a UNI listing, knowing demand and FOMO. No respect for the community_”. - April 14th

“_Don't get me wrong, it's a great project and all. But wtf is going through their(devs) heads thinking this was a good distribution idea. As in all of it. A fraction of a fraction went to regular people and bots_”. - April 14th

“_I've built my ADA because I like the slow growth, peer review, and focus on problem solving. Learning and sharing with others as I go. Defi is hot and a fair offering is great spirit, but that was a show put on to claim fair offering. Be better or just stay an ERC20 project_.” - April 14th

#### 6.13 PM - Unprecedented Levels of Participation

“_I think your celebratory gif is in bad taste, and an affront to all who followed and supported you, only to be let down at the last moment.”_ - April 14th, 16 Likes.

“_The whole thing is a red flag since the very beginning, especially when they seek VC funds at $100mil valuation, having no actual product and TG admins who don’t really know much other than directing the community to their standard FAQ page_.

Shameful.” April 14th

“_Aha yea their telegram admins are awful! I can’t believe they told multiple people their wasn’t going to be an IDO after the countdown. Does seem like a very “fair” thing to me_” April 14th.

**Responses to the Medium Article:**

Why dont you address why you only offered 0.2% to the public? Tricking your community and lying to them to then have mr tiago serodio saying how fantastic it was to have the money in his pocket

**47 Claps**

Watching peoples messages deleted and then getting banned for asking for an explanation on the Telegram and seeing major official IOHK supported Cardano projects outright ban OCC from interacting with their platform forever gives me a bad sinking feeling. The Cardano community is blemished by this project.

**34 Claps**

I can appreciate that folks feel frustrated, it is tough to feel the anticipation and not know what to expect and for things to have gone so quickly it was a real bummer to miss the IDO. I'd been watching closely for weeks, reading and learning as much as possible hoping i wouldn't miss it. Still missed it due to the sheer volume that probably caused lag in the website for some of us. While i definitely feel bummed out, i still have a lot of respect for the team and how they have managed what everything. The whitepaper, the FAQs, the articles, the moderation of their social platforms; all done professionally and with a lot of respect shown to the community. They've done what they thought was best. There weren't any tricks. While it didn't work in my favor, if i put myself in their shoes i'm not sure what i would have done differently. Anyone who says otherwise hasn't perhaps studied or really taken in the tokenomics and how the ecosystem is built. I hope everyone will take ownership of their own frustration, it's fine to vent, i just think blaming the team is unfair. And hopefully everyone comes back and realizes there is still so much promise with OCCAM.
